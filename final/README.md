# FINAL PROJECT
## Bloodrite Character Submission

My project is for a TTRPG game that I'm running. I'm planning on making it into a podcast eventually, but I like to 'crowdsource' worldbuilding. I'll let other friends and people in contact with me submit ideas, locations, complications, and other things about the world for my inclusion in the game. One of the more common things is people submitting character ideas. This project will be able to easily ingest character submissions, and then read them out so I can analyze the data.
